<h4>The Skinny</h4>
<p>THE MOBTOWN BALLROOM, located in historic Pigtown, is Baltimoreâ€™s premiere location for social dance events, dance classes, live music, conferences, weddings, and general mayhem. We host belly dance, burlesque, art shows, and pretty much everything you could want in an evening out. We restored a beautiful 1870s church with a 2,500 square foot sprung dance floor and a 1,200 square foot stage.</p>

<p>The Mobtown Ballroom is available for weddings, parties, conferences, and a wide array of events. We have retained the original splendor of this 19th century church, while making some improvements, including the installation of a gorgeous, 3,000 square-foot oak floor (the best dance floor on the East Coast), the construction of a beautiful oak bar and sound booth (both of which were salvaged from original church furniture), and some of the most powerful air-conditioning known to man.  All of our alterations were made using repurposed materials within the building, leaving this space with a classic and flexible elegance.</p>

<p>The Mobtown Ballroom is not affiliated with any religion and welcomes all regardless of race, gender, class, or sexual orientation. Whether you want to dance, host a birthday party, or get married, our doors are open.</p>

<h4>Weddings (Gay, Straight, or Otherwise)</h4>

<p>We have an experienced team on hand to help make your wedding happen in our space. The Ballroom has some of the beauty and transcendent elegance of a traditional church combined with the functionality of a theatre and entertainment center. It thus serves perfectly for both the wedding and the reception.

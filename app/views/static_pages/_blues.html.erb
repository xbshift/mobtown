<h4>What is blues dancing?</h4>
<p>Blues is a fun, creative, and expressive style of dance that can be done to music in a wide variety of styles and tempos, including high energy Chicago blues, slinky jazz blues, and soulful Delta blues. First developed alongside jazz and blues music during the early 20th century, blues dancing prospered over the years in small, intimate venues like juke joints and house parties, then gained new popularity more recently with the revival of Lindy hop. Modern blues dance is based on vintage styles like Slow Drag and often borrows elements from other dances, like Lindy hop, West Coast Swing, and Argentine tango. Blues is constantly evolving, but is grounded in the fundamentals of partner connection, pulse, improvisation, and musicality.</p>
